<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Initially started by @0xAnalyst, I will try to update this repo with my humble contributions.
It is meant to provide security analysts a 'cheatsheet' or 'guideline' to be used alongside CarbonBlack Response

This repository will contain mainly 2 things:
- Search queries to help security analysts finding malicious activities.
- Response actions to help security analysts performing incident response activities.

Please don't hesitate to propose any additional queries and response actions for inclusion in this repository.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Redefine and document the git structure
- [ ] Document usage guide
- [ ] Update old queries if needed
- [ ] Create new content

See the [open issues](https://github.com/0xAnalyst/DefenderATPQueries/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

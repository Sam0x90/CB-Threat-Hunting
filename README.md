# CB-Threat-Hunting
Initially started by @0xAnalyst, I will try to update this repo continuously.
It is meant to provide security analysts a 'cheatsheet' or 'guideline' to be used alongside CarbonBlack Response

This repository will contains mainly 2 things:
- Search queries to help security analysts finding malicious activities.
- Response actions to help security analysts performing incident response activities. 

## Next steps
- [ ] Redefine and document the git structure
- [ ] Document usage guide
- [ ] Update old queries if needed
- [ ] Create new content

## CarbonBlack MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This will contain tested search queries to map most of Mitre ATTACK Framework to CarbonBlack. Will be updated from time to time

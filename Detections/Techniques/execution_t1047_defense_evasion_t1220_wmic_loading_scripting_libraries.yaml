name: Execution, T1047, Defense Evasion, T1220 - WMIC loading scripting libraries
index_type: events
description: Detects threat actors proxy executing code and bypassing application controls by leveraging wmic and the `/FORMAT` argument switch to download and execute an XSL file (i.e js, vbs, etc). The /Format argument can be bypassed easily but if detection is too noisy, better to add it in cmdline field.
